This is an example of a cURL command.

You need to replace SEARCHSTRING with your search terms.

The output will be saved to a file called response.json in the folder /folder



curl -X POST "https://formstrap.com/IconSearchAPI/v1/search" \
     -d "search=SEARCHSTRING" \
     -o /folder/response.json
